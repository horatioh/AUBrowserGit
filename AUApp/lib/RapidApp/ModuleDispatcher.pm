=head2 $ctlr->dispatch( $c, @args )

dispatch takes a catalyst instance, and a list of path arguments.  It does some setup work,
and then calls "Controller" on the target module to begin handling the arguments.

dispatch takes care of the special exception handling/saving, and also sets up the
views to display the exceptions.

It also is responsible for cleaning temporary values from the Modules after the request is over.
